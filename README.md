# NodeMCU-IoT
NodeMCU based script using BLYNK Android App.

This two .ino files needs some data like wifi name and password for connecting NodeMCU with
internet.

I used BLYNK App for giving input and wath output. 
Please be sure you have added your own BLYNK App Token in file so .ino file runs without any error or 
without getting undesirable results.
